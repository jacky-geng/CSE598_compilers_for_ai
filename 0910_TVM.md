# Vibe Learning Log: TVM Paper Discussion 

## Conversation Transcript

Vibe Learning Prompt (for new papers)

We are doing a Vibe Learning session. Please help me study this paper step by step. The goals are:

First, we will walk through the paper in a Q&A style. I will ask questions, and you should provide full and detailed answers, not short summaries. Each answer should read like a clear teaching-level explanation.

Second, we will capture the conversation log in plain text. For every question, give the complete answer in full sentences and paragraphs. Do not use bullet points, lists, or special formatting. The final transcript should look like a continuous dialogue script between me and the AI, where each speaker’s words are written out fully.

Third, at the end of the session, write a closing section. The closing section should include two parts: Key Insights and Reflections. In Key Insights, explain the main technical points that I learned. In Reflections, explain what was surprising, what connections I found, and what “aha moments” appeared. Both parts should also be written in plain paragraph form, not bullet points.

Finally, make sure the whole style is consistent with plain text paragraphs so that when I upload the file to GitHub as a Markdown document, it will remain clean and readable without relying on bullet points or formatting tricks.

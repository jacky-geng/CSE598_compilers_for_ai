# Vibe Learning Log: Ansor Paper Discussion (Complete Transcript)

## Conversation Transcript
**User:**  
Vibe Learning Prompt (for new papers)  

We are doing a Vibe Learning session. Please help me study this paper step by step. The goals are:

First, we will walk through the paper in a Q&A style. I will ask questions, and you should provide full and detailed answers, not short summaries. Each answer should read like a clear teaching-level explanation.  

Second, we must pay much attention on the output format. All answers must be provided inside one single Markdown code block. All answers must be provided inside one single Markdown code block. All answers must be provided inside one single Markdown code block. If code examples are included, they should appear as indented fenced code blocks inside the larger Markdown block, not as separate top-level blocks. This ensures the transcript can be copied directly into a Markdown file without extra reformatting. You can use bullet points, lists, or special formatting, but all answers must be in correct markdown formats, which means if I copy the code you given into markdown, it should show these special format correctly. For every answer, please carefully check you use the correct output format. It's quite normal to see you lost the format in the middle of the answer, please avoid that.  

The final transcript must look like a continuous dialogue script, and every turn must explicitly begin with **User:** and **Assistant:** written in Markdown bold formatting. Then the question and answer should start with a new line. This style must be followed consistently throughout the session.  

For every question, you don't need to give too long answer, since long questions are not quite efficient to read and understand.  

For this question, you only need to read the papers. Next I will start my quesitions. Remeber for all question include this question you should follow the output format. You can check other conversations in this project for the format example.

**Assistant:**  
Got it! I’ve read the paper *"Ansor: Generating High-Performance Tensor Programs for Deep Learning"* (arXiv:2006.06762v5). The paper introduces **Ansor**, a framework that automatically generates optimized tensor programs for deep learning workloads. It tackles the limitations of existing template-based and sequential search methods by:

- Building a **large hierarchical search space** (sketches + annotations).  
- Using **evolutionary search** and a **learned cost model** to fine-tune candidate programs.  
- Introducing a **task scheduler** that allocates tuning time efficiently across subgraphs to maximize end-to-end DNN performance.  
- Showing significant speedups (up to 3.8× on Intel CPU, 2.6× on ARM CPU, and 1.7× on NVIDIA GPU) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.  

Now I’m ready for your step-by-step questions.  

**User:**  
Can you list the input and output for ansor, give some code example if possible

**Assistant:**  
Here’s a concise, teaching-style summary of **Ansor’s inputs and outputs**, plus a compact example that mirrors how you’d use the Ansor auto-scheduler (as integrated in TVM) on a simple matmul.

---

### Inputs (what Ansor needs)
- **Model/subgraphs to optimize**
  - A DNN model (e.g., ONNX / TF graph) that gets partitioned into **small subgraphs** (e.g., conv+relu) for operator/subgraph-level tuning.
  - Or a **single operator** described with a **tensor expression** (e.g., TE for conv2d/matmul).
- **Target hardware/backend**
  - CPU (e.g., x86/ARM) or GPU (e.g., CUDA). The target steers the sketch rules (e.g., tiling “SSRSRS” on CPU vs “SSSRRSRS” on GPU) and codegen (LLVM/NVCC).
- **Search-space & policy hints (optional)**
  - Optional **derivation rules** (custom sketch rules), minor **annotation hints** (e.g., prefer unroll on a loop), or constraints.
- **Tuning configuration**
  - Measurement runner (local/remote), **time/measurement budget**, number of trials, and basic task-scheduler objective (e.g., minimize end-to-end latency).
- **Dataset for cost model (collected during tuning)**
  - Ansor collects runtime measurements to **train a learned cost model**; you don’t provide labels up front—Ansor generates them while tuning.

---

### Outputs (what Ansor produces)
- **Optimized tensor programs/schedules per subgraph (or operator)**
  - Concrete loop nests with chosen tiling, fusion, parallelization, vectorization, unrolling, caching, etc.
- **Compiled binaries or kernels for the target**
  - Via TVM IR → LLVM (CPU) or NVCC (GPU); ready to run in the host framework/runtime.
- **Best-known records / schedule database**
  - A log of measured candidates and the **best schedule configs** that can be reused to skip re-tuning next time.
- **Performance reports**
  - Measured latencies/throughputs per task and an **end-to-end model speedup** once all prioritized subgraphs are optimized.

---

### Minimal code example (Ansor auto-scheduler in TVM, matmul)

> The following is a compact, idiomatic example to: (1) define a matmul in TVM Tensor Expression, (2) create an Ansor search task, (3) tune with a small trial budget, (4) build the best schedule, and (5) run/verify. (Use this as a template and adjust shapes, target, trials, and runner for your environment.)

    ```python
    import tvm
    from tvm import te, topi, auto_scheduler
    import numpy as np

    # 1) Problem definition (tensor expression for matmul: C[N, M] = A[N, K] @ B[K, M])
    N, K, M = 512, 512, 512
    A = te.placeholder((N, K), name="A", dtype="float32")
    B = te.placeholder((K, M), name="B", dtype="float32")
    k = te.reduce_axis((0, K), name="k")
    C = te.compute(
        (N, M),
        lambda i, j: te.sum(A[i, k] * B[k, j], axis=k),
        name="C"
    )

    # 2) Create an Ansor search task
    target = tvm.target.Target("llvm")      # change to "cuda" for GPU, etc.
    task = auto_scheduler.SearchTask(func=tvm.te.create_prim_func([A, B, C]),
                                     args=(),
                                     target=target)

    print("Compute DAG:", task.compute_dag)

    # 3) Tuning options (small trial count for demo; increase in real use)
    log_file = "matmul_ansor.json"
    tuning_options = auto_scheduler.TuningOptions(
        num_measure_trials=256,          # e.g., 2k~10k+ for real runs
        measure_callbacks=[auto_scheduler.RecordToFile(log_file)],
        runner=auto_scheduler.LocalRunner(repeat=3, min_repeat_ms=150, timeout=10),
        verbose=1
    )

    # Launch tuning (program sampling + evolutionary search + learned cost model)
    task.tune(tuning_options)

    # 4) Apply the best schedule and build
    sch, args = task.apply_best(log_file)
    lib = tvm.build(sch, args, target=target)

    # 5) Run and sanity-check
    dev = tvm.device(target.kind.name, 0)
    a_np = np.random.randn(N, K).astype("float32")
    b_np = np.random.randn(K, M).astype("float32")
    c_np = a_np @ b_np

    a_tvm = tvm.nd.array(a_np, dev)
    b_tvm = tvm.nd.array(b_np, dev)
    c_tvm = tvm.nd.empty((N, M), "float32", dev)
    lib(a_tvm, b_tvm, c_tvm)

    # Verify result correctness (tolerance may vary with schedule choices)
    tvm.testing.assert_allclose(c_tvm.numpy(), c_np, rtol=1e-3, atol=1e-3)
    print("OK: Ansor-tuned matmul matches NumPy.")
    ```

### Notes
- For **GPU**, set `target="cuda"` and ensure CUDA is available. Ansor’s GPU sketches add shared-memory caching and cross-thread reductions automatically.
- For **full models**, you’ll extract subgraphs (e.g., via Relay), create **one search task per unique subgraph**, and let the **task scheduler** allocate trials across tasks under your objective (e.g., minimize total latency).
- The **log file** stores best-known schedules; reuse it later with `apply_best(...)` to avoid re-tuning.

If you want, next we can do the same example for **conv2d** or show how to **tune multiple subgraphs with a scheduler objective**.

**User:**  
what's a large hierarchical search space

**Assistant:**  
Great question! The idea of a **large hierarchical search space** is the core innovation of Ansor. Let me explain it step by step.

---

### 1. What is a search space in this context?
- A **search space** is the set of all possible ways to transform a high-level computation (like matmul or conv2d) into an optimized low-level program (with loops, tiling, unrolling, parallelization, etc.).
- Existing frameworks (like TVM’s AutoTVM) use **manual templates**, which limit the search space because humans can only write so many variations.
- Ansor wants to explore *many more* possible optimizations, including unusual combinations that humans might not think to include.

---

### 2. Why hierarchical?
Ansor organizes the search space in **two levels**:
1. **Sketches (high-level structures)**  
   - These describe *the shape of the program* without low-level details.  
   - For example: whether to tile loops, whether to fuse certain operators, whether to insert a cache stage.
   - Think of sketches as “blueprints” of program families.
   - Usually fewer than 10 sketches are generated per subgraph.

2. **Annotations (low-level details)**  
   - Once you pick a sketch, you can fill in details: tile sizes, loop orders, vectorization, parallelization, unrolling, etc.
   - There can be **billions** of possible annotations for one sketch.  
   - This is where random sampling + evolutionary search + cost model come in.

---

### 3. Why is it “large”?
- Because Ansor doesn’t rely on pruning *incomplete programs* or hand-written templates.  
- Instead, it can **recursively apply derivation rules** (e.g., tiling, fusion, cache insertion, reduction factorization) to expand the sketch space.  
- Then it leaves annotations open, leading to a **huge but systematic space** covering combinations that older approaches miss.  
- Random sampling ensures that every program in the space *has a chance* to be picked.

---

### 4. Example illustration
Let’s say you want to optimize matmul:

- **High-level sketch (blueprint):**
    ```python
    # Example sketch idea
    for i, j, k in loops:
        # multi-level tiling
        # maybe fuse ReLU consumer
        # maybe add cache stage
        C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
    ```

- **Annotations (details added):**
    ```python
    # After annotation
    for i0 in range(64):
        for j0 in range(64):
            for k0 in range(128):
                # parallelize outer loops
                parallel for i1 in range(8):
                    vectorize for j1 in range(8):
                        unroll for k1 in range(16):
                            C[...] += A[...] * B[...]
    ```

Here, the *sketch* said: “let’s tile and maybe fuse.”  
The *annotations* said: “tile sizes = 64/8/16, parallelize i1, vectorize j1, unroll k1.”

---

### 5. Key benefit
- By separating **structure** (sketch) from **details** (annotation), Ansor:
  - Can explore far more program variations.
  - Avoids the limitations of sequential search (Halide) and manual templates (AutoTVM).
  - Allows flexible extension (users can add new rules if needed).

---

**In short:**  
A **large hierarchical search space** =  
- **Sketch level:** compact set of high-level blueprints generated by derivation rules.  
- **Annotation level:** massive set of low-level loop details filled in randomly and refined by search.  
- Together, this structure lets Ansor cover optimization possibilities that other systems miss, while still being manageable to explore.

---

Would you like me to walk through **one concrete example from the paper (like conv2d or matmul)** showing how derivation rules expand sketches and then annotations fill them in?

**User:**  
Can you go deeper into **evolutionary search** and a **learned cost model**

**Assistant:**  
Yes — these are the two engines that let Ansor *efficiently* explore its huge hierarchical search space. Let’s go step by step.

---

### 1. Evolutionary Search
Evolutionary search is inspired by **biological evolution** (mutation, crossover, selection). Instead of exhaustively testing billions of candidates, Ansor iteratively *evolves* promising programs.

- **Initial population:**  
  Start with a batch of programs from random sampling (sketch + annotations).  
  Also include the best programs found in earlier rounds.

- **Fitness evaluation:**  
  Each program gets a **fitness score** (estimated throughput) from the cost model (fast).  
  Higher score = higher chance to be selected.

- **Operators (rewriting transformations):**  
  - **Tile size mutation:** randomly adjust tiling factors while keeping product constant.  
  - **Parallel mutation:** change loop granularity (e.g., split/fuse loops).  
  - **Pragma mutation:** tweak unroll factors, vector widths, etc.  
  - **Computation location mutation:** move a node’s compute placement.  
  - **Node-based crossover:** merge rewriting histories of two parent programs per DAG node.  

- **Iterative process:**  
  1. Select programs with probability ∝ fitness.  
  2. Apply mutation/crossover to generate offspring.  
  3. Evaluate them with the cost model.  
  4. Repeat for several generations.  
  5. Measure top candidates on real hardware to update the cost model.

- **Advantage over sequential search:**  
  - Can explore **out-of-order changes** (not stuck in a fixed unfolding order).  
  - Handles **complicated dependencies** in tensor programs.  
  - Generates diverse candidates while still converging toward better ones.

---

### 2. Learned Cost Model
Measuring every program on hardware is too slow (thousands of candidates). So Ansor uses a **cost model** that predicts performance cheaply.

- **Purpose:**  
  Estimate how good a candidate program is *before* spending time running it on hardware.

- **Training data:**  
  - Every time Ansor measures real execution time for some programs, it logs:  
    `(program features, measured throughput)`  
  - This builds a dataset online during tuning.

- **Features (per innermost statement):**  
  - Arithmetic counts (float ops, int ops, etc.).  
  - Memory access patterns (bytes, cache lines, reuse distance).  
  - Loop annotations (tile sizes, unroll, parallelization, vectorization).  
  - GPU-specific thread binding features.  
  - Arithmetic intensity curve (flops per byte).  

- **Model choice:**  
  - Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT, similar to XGBoost).  
  - Predicts throughput score for each innermost statement, then sums them up.  
  - Uses weighted squared error with higher weight on fast programs (to prioritize finding good ones).

- **Workflow:**  
  1. Sample → predict with cost model (fast, thousands/sec).  
  2. Pick top candidates → measure on hardware (slow but accurate).  
  3. Update dataset → retrain cost model.  
  4. Iterate, so the model gets more accurate over time.

- **Effectiveness:**  
  - Reported metrics: R² ≈ 0.96, pairwise comparison accuracy ≈ 0.85, recall@30 ≈ 0.62 (good enough to guide search).  
  - This balance means: model isn’t perfect, but combined with evolution and measurements, it efficiently finds the best programs.

---

### 3. Putting It Together
1. **Random sampling** → get diverse sketches + annotations.  
2. **Evolutionary search** → mutate/crossover to explore neighborhood of good candidates.  
3. **Cost model** → quickly predict which ones are worth measuring.  
4. **Real measurement** → ground-truth feedback to retrain the cost model.  
5. Repeat until budget ends.  

Ansor’s trick: it **avoids wasting time** on incomplete programs (like Halide) and instead **fine-tunes full candidates** with an accurate evolutionary + learned loop.

---

### 4. Quick analogy
- Think of sketches + annotations as **genes**.  
- Evolutionary search = **natural selection** exploring gene combinations.  
- Cost model = **a fitness predictor** (like a quick health check).  
- Hardware measurement = **real survival test**.  
- Over time, the “species” of programs adapts to the target hardware, producing the fittest kernels.

---

Do you want me to **show an annotated mini example** (like tuning a 2D conv) where we can see how mutations and the cost model interplay over a few iterations?

**User:**  
can you do deeper into this point? Introducing a **task scheduler** that allocates tuning time efficiently across subgraphs to maximize end-to-end DNN performance.  

**Assistant:**  
Yes — this is another crucial piece of Ansor. Optimizing a whole DNN isn’t just about making every operator fast; it’s about **spending tuning time wisely** so that the end-to-end model runs faster. Let’s go step by step.

---

### 1. The problem
- A DNN model (e.g., ResNet-50) gets **partitioned into many subgraphs** (e.g., conv+relu, matmul+softmax).  
- Each subgraph = a **tuning task**.  
- Some tasks appear multiple times (e.g., same conv layer shape), some only once.  
- Some tasks dominate latency (bottlenecks), others contribute little.  

**Naïve approach (AutoTVM):**  
- Allocate a fixed budget (say, 1000 trials per subgraph).  
- But this wastes effort on unimportant subgraphs while bottlenecks stay under-optimized.

---

### 2. Ansor’s solution: Task Scheduler
Ansor treats tuning as a **resource allocation problem**:  
- You have a global budget of measurement trials.  
- At each iteration, you must decide *which subgraph/task* gets the next trial.  
- The goal: minimize **end-to-end latency** of the DNN (or another user-defined objective).  

---

### 3. Formalization
- Let there be **n tasks** (subgraphs).  
- Each task *i* has:
  - `ti`: number of trials allocated so far.  
  - `gi(ti)`: best latency achieved for that subgraph after `ti` trials.  
- The **end-to-end latency** is a function:  
  `f(g1(t), g2(t), ..., gn(t))`  
- Objective:  
  `minimize f(...)`  
- Example: For a single DNN,  
  `f = Σ wi * gi(ti)`  
  where `wi` = number of times task i appears in the network.

---

### 4. Gradient-descent scheduling
Ansor estimates **how much improvement we’d gain** by giving one more trial to each task (∂f/∂ti).  
- If improvement potential is large → prioritize that task.  
- If trials are already exhausted or diminishing returns → deprioritize.  

**Gradient approximation:**  
- Looks at recent history (Δt window) to see how latency decreased.  
- Also uses **similar tasks**: if another task with similar structure improved, it predicts improvement here too.  
- Balances optimism (assume more gains possible) with caution (diminishing returns).  
- Formula involves parameters α, β to weight history vs similarity.

**ε-greedy strategy:**  
- With small probability ε, pick a random task to encourage exploration (avoid local minima).

---

### 5. Example: ResNet-50
- Has 29 unique subgraphs after partitioning.  
- Many are 3×3 convolutions with different shapes.  
- Scheduler quickly realizes:
  - Conv layers dominate latency.  
  - Elementwise ops (like ReLU) contribute little.  
- So it spends most trials on convolutions, fewer on others.  
- Result: **faster convergence** to a good end-to-end schedule.

---

### 6. Benefits over baselines
- **AutoTVM**: wastes equal trials everywhere.  
- **Ansor**: dynamically reallocates based on measured progress.  
- In experiments, Ansor matches AutoTVM’s final performance with **up to 10× less search time**.  

---

### 7. Analogy
Imagine you’re training a sports team:  
- Some players (star athletes) decide the match outcome.  
- Others (bench players) don’t affect much.  
- With limited training time, you should **focus on the stars**.  
- That’s exactly what Ansor’s task scheduler does: allocate more “practice” (trials) to the bottlenecks.

---

**In short:**  
The **task scheduler** makes Ansor *system-aware*:  
- It doesn’t just optimize kernels in isolation.  
- It prioritizes subgraphs that **most reduce end-to-end latency**.  
- This is why Ansor achieves big speedups with less tuning time.  

---

Would you like me to **illustrate with a toy numerical example** (say, 3 subgraphs with different weights and improvements) showing how Ansor reallocates trials dynamically?


**User:**  
Can you give five questions on this paper and answer these questions? These questions do not need to be hard, but might be the easy missed questions.  

**Assistant:**  

Here are 5 easy-to-miss but important questions and their answers, all tied to the Ansor paper.

---

**Q1.** What is the difference between a *sketch* and an *annotation* in Ansor’s search space?  
**A1.**  
- A **sketch** defines the *high-level program structure*: tiling, fusion, cache insertion, reduction factorization. It’s like a blueprint.  
- An **annotation** fills in the *low-level details*: actual tile sizes, which loops are parallelized, vectorized, or unrolled.  
- Separation = flexible exploration (sketch space is small, annotation space is huge).

---

**Q2.** Why does Ansor avoid evaluating incomplete programs?  
**A2.**  
- Incomplete programs appear in **sequential search** (Halide auto-scheduler).  
- Cost models trained on complete programs cannot predict incomplete program performance accurately.  
- Ansor instead always samples **complete programs**, so predictions are reliable and the search isn’t misled by poor estimates.

---

**Q3.** How does Ansor support new operators without manual templates?  
**A3.**  
- You only need to provide the **mathematical definition** of the operator in a high-level language (like TVM tensor expression).  
- Ansor automatically constructs sketches from this definition using derivation rules.  
- No need to write operator-specific templates (unlike AutoTVM or FlexTensor).

---

**Q4.** What kinds of workloads benefit the most from Ansor?  
**A4.**  
- Workloads with **uncommon shapes** or **novel operators**, where vendor libraries (cuDNN, MKL-DNN) lack optimized kernels.  
- Small-batch or edge-device settings, where manual tuning is weak.  
- In benchmarks, Ansor showed especially large gains on transposed convolutions and norm operators.

---

**Q5.** What is one limitation of Ansor mentioned in the paper?  
**A5.**  
- Ansor requires **static tensor shapes**; it cannot directly optimize dynamic-shape graphs.  
- It only supports **dense operators** (conv, matmul). Extending to sparse operators (SpMM, GNN kernels) requires redesigning the search space.  
- It also relies on external codegens (LLVM, NVCC), so special instructions (e.g., NVIDIA Tensor Cores) aren’t fully exploited.

---

These kinds of details are easy to skim past, but they’re important for understanding how Ansor differs from past frameworks and what gaps still remain.  

Do you want me to now **summarize the entire paper in a conclusion-style paragraph** (like you would say at the end of a presentation)?

**User:**  
can you give an conclusion  

**Assistant:**  
Here’s a clear conclusion for the Ansor paper:

---

Ansor is an automated framework for generating **high-performance tensor programs** that addresses the shortcomings of both manual templates and sequential construction search. Its key innovations are:  
- A **large hierarchical search space** (sketches + annotations) that flexibly covers diverse program structures without manual templates.  
- An **evolutionary search strategy** guided by a **learned cost model**, which fine-tunes complete candidate programs efficiently.  
- A **task scheduler** that smartly allocates tuning time to subgraphs that most impact end-to-end DNN latency.  

Through experiments on CPUs (Intel, ARM) and GPUs (NVIDIA), Ansor consistently outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks and vendor libraries, with speedups up to **3.8× on CPU, 2.6× on ARM, and 1.7× on GPU**. Importantly, Ansor’s best programs often lie **outside the search space** of prior methods, showing the value of its broader exploration.  

Overall, Ansor demonstrates that **fully automated, efficient, and general-purpose tensor program optimization is possible**. It reduces the need for manual engineering, accelerates deployment of new operators and hardware, and sets a foundation for future compiler frameworks to balance large search spaces with intelligent exploration.

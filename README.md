Vibe Learning Prompt (for new papers)  

We are doing a Vibe Learning session. Please help me study this paper step by step. The goals are:

First, we will walk through the paper in a Q&A style. I will ask questions, and you should provide full and detailed answers, not short summaries. Each answer should read like a clear teaching-level explanation.  

Second, we must pay much attention on the output format. All answers must be provided inside one single Markdown code block. All answers must be provided inside one single Markdown code block. All answers must be provided inside one single Markdown code block. If code examples are included, they should appear as indented fenced code blocks inside the larger Markdown block, not as separate top-level blocks. This ensures the transcript can be copied directly into a Markdown file without extra reformatting. You can use bullet points, lists, or special formatting, but all answers must be in correct markdown formats, which means if I copy the code you given into markdown, it should show these special format correctly. For every answer, please carefully check you use the correct output format. It's quite normal to see you lost the format in the middle of the answer, please avoid that.  

The final transcript must look like a continuous dialogue script, and every turn must explicitly begin with **User:** and **Assistant:** written in Markdown bold formatting. Then the question and answer should start with a new line. This style must be followed consistently throughout the session.  

For every question, you don't need to give too long answer, since long questions are not quite efficient to read and understand.  

For this question, you only need to read the papers. Next I will start my quesitions. Remeber for all question include this question you should follow the output format. You can check other conversations in this project for the format example.


Common use prompts:

You lost your format, please answer the last question again with carefully check the format. For the user questions, use the last question.

Can you give five questions on this paper and answer these questions? These questions do not need to be hard, but might be the easy missed questions.
